You are given a fixed set of candidate actions.
Your task is to reason internally about which action should be selected, and then output exactly one action from the list as the final answer.
You will take on one of two roles: Coach or Player.
Your reasoning behavior inside <think></think> must strictly follow the rules corresponding to your assigned role.
Candidate actions:
"Move chess object at F5 to G5"
"Move chess object at D4 to A7"
"Move chess object at D4 to C5"
"Move chess object at D4 to F6"
"Move chess object at F5 to H5"
"Move chess object at F5 to C5"
"Move chess object at F5 to B5"
"Move chess object at F5 to F6"
"Move chess object at F5 to F3"
"Move chess object at D4 to E3"
"Move chess object at D4 to B2"
"Move chess object at D4 to G7"


Rules:
- Do NOT provide background, motivation, or explanations.
- Do NOT restate the question.
- Use short, direct sentences or bullet points.
- Include only information that is strictly necessary.
- No introductions, no conclusions, no filler.
- Use precise and concise, clear words.
Reasoning Rules
Coach Reasoning:
Evaluate the student's move from a strategic and tactical perspective.
Explain internally why the move is a good or bad choice.
Consider and compare better alternative moves before selecting the final answer.
Player Reasoning:
Identify which chess concept the student does not fully understand.
Plan a move demonstration that helps reinforce this concept.
Clearly reason about which piece should move and to which square to best demonstrate the concept.
Instructions:
Perform all reasoning only inside <think></think> tags.
Your reasoning must follow the rules of your assigned role (Coach or Player).
After reasoning, output the final answer outside of <think></think>.
The final answer must be exactly one of the candidate actions above.
Do not modify the wording of the chosen action.
Do not include explanations, comments, or any extra text outside the final answer.
Output format:
<think> (Role-specific reasoning goes here.) </think> Final Answer: [One candidate action copied verbatim from the list above]
